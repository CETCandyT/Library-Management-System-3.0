# Library-Management-System-2.0
Phase 1 - Software Implementation
Logic and Functionality 

The Library Management System(LMS) application is designed to streamline library operations. This provides functionalities such as adding, removing, and managing books. The user should be able to check in and out books by barcode and title. This application uses Java programming language and follows object-oriented principles. This system includes classes such as LibraryManagementSystem, Book, and Library each serving specific roles in managing the library database. As this application continues to evolve, we are aiming to integrate the use of SQL or SQLite for database improvement. 

These changes allow the following:
1. Add books
2. Remove Books by barcode
3. Remove book by title
4. Check out a book
5. Check in a book
6. Display contents of the database
7. Implemented features to manage the book list, ensuring it remains saved in the database. Note that functionality will evolve once SQLite or SQL integrates.
8. Improved selection list display for better readability and updated user prompt.

# Library-Management-System-2.0 - GUI Main Entry - Update
Phase 2 - UI Design - Software Implementation 
The MainFrame.java class serves as an entry point for the GUI user interface. 
This class creates/presents the user with a GUI menu with multiple functions buttons and fields to enter user supplied data information.
The This user-friendly GUI menu provides functions such as adding, removing, checking books in/out, upload books from a txt file, and database display.

The Library Management System user will be capable of the following:
1. Add books
2. Upload a comma-delimited text file with a list of books.
3. Remove Books by barcode
4. Remove book by title
5. Check out a book
6. Check in a book
7. Display contents of the database
8. Exit the main menu

As a reminder, these functions will change once SQLite or MySQL database is integrated in phase 3.
